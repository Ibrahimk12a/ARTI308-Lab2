# ARTI308-Lab2
**Dataset Description**
For this lab, I chose the **Housing Dataset**. It contains **5,000 records** and **7 columns**. The dataset includes information like the average income in the area, the age of the house, the number of rooms, and the population.

**Machine Learning Problem**
* **Problem Type:** Regression (because I am predicting a number).
* **Target Variable:** `Price`.
* **Goal:** I want to build a model that uses features like income and house age to predict the final price of a house.
